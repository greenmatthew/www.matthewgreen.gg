Hello, I am Matthew Green, a 22-year-old computer science graduate from the University of Texas at Arlington, having earned my degree in December 2022. Having nurtured a passion for video game programming since high school, I am on a mission to turn this passion into a fulfilling career, where I can contribute to creating enthralling gaming experiences. Over the years, I've found myself naturally gravitating towards leadership roles in group projects, hinting at a potential pathway towards lead positions in the future.

With a programming journey spanning nearly 5 years, I have honed my skills across various languages and tools. Over the span of nearly two years, while completing my degree and post-graduation, I had the privilege of developing a VR application aimed at enriching engineering design education. This experience not only honed my programming skills but also offered a practical glimpse into the collaborative and innovative environment of game development.

Currently, I am keen on exploring the realms of Unreal Engine, Rust, and Bevy Engine to broaden my technical horizon. I'm drawn to Unreal Engine due to its renowned graphical fidelity and performance, which seems to be garnering significant attention in the industry. On the other hand, my interest in graphics programming has led me towards Rust and Bevy. Particularly, I am captivated by the realms of procedural generation, shaders, and leveraging hardware acceleration through graphics cards. Although my university course in computer graphics left much to be desired, I've taken the reins of my learning journey. I've embarked on several small projects in Unity, delving into both 2D and 3D procedural terrain generation which has been a captivating venture. Eager to further explore procedural generation, I've initiated my expedition into learning Rust. I envision utilizing the Bevy framework for an upcoming project, anticipating it to be a more conducive environment for building a procedurally generated game from scratch, as compared to the constraints I encountered with Unity.

Beyond the professional sphere, I am an avid consumer and creator of entertainment, whether it's enjoying YouTube videos, gaming with friends, or building a collection of movies. My penchant for self-hosting has led to a personal server setup, where I host a myriad of services for both entertainment and utility, embodying my knack for combining technical skills with personal interests.

Below is a showcase of my projects, skills, work experiences, and educational background along with my contact details. I welcome discussions, collaborations, or opportunities that align with my professional journey and aspirations in the gaming industry.
