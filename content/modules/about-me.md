Hello, I'm Matthew Green—a 23-year-old Software Engineer with a passion for both tech and a well-rounded lifestyle. When I'm not immersed in coding or game development, you'll find me playing video games, diving into Dungeons & Dragons sessions, rock climbing, or hitting the tennis courts. I also love collecting physical copies of movies and TV series, and I keep busy with self-hosting projects and managing my homelab.

I began programming 7.5 years ago after taking a Computer Programming & Game Design course in high school, which sparked my passion for game development. From that moment, I knew exactly what I wanted to do. After graduating high school, I attended the University of Texas at Arlington to earn my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.

During my time at UTA, I honed my skills through a range of projects. I collaborated on the development of two games—[Trapstronauts](https://www.matthewgreen.gg/trapstronauts/) and [Project Calamity](https://www.matthewgreen.gg/project-calamity/)—as part of my coursework. However, my most significant experience was a paid, part-time role where I spent 1.5 years developing a [VR application](https://www.matthewgreen.gg/cad-model-viewer/) in collaboration with an engineering professor. This project was designed as a learning tool for Mechanical Engineering students studying Computer-Aided Design (CAD). These projects not only deepened my expertise in Unity, C#, and even Godot, but also provided invaluable real-world experience.

After graduating, I grew curious about pushing my boundaries further by creating not just a game, but a game engine from scratch. This was a monumental task—and yes, it really does take 1,000 lines of code to draw a triangle on the screen, as they say. The outcome was a bare-bones game engine complete with a functional entity scene-graph system coupled with an existing ECS library, capable of powering a basic game. The accompanying [project](https://www.matthewgreen.gg/velecs-and-harvest-havoc/) was more of a tech demo than a fully realized game/game engine combo, but it was an invaluable learning experience in understanding game engine fundamentals.

Eventually, I joined Rad TV—a startup offering a unique digital streaming service similar to YouTube. At Rad TV, I spearheaded the development of the [PlayStation VR2 version of the Rad TV application](https://www.matthewgreen.gg/rad-tv-for-ps-vr2/), taking over and enhancing the work of previous engineers. I navigated Sony's QA process to release it as the first hybrid media application on PS5. Following the launch, I continued refining the product by addressing user feedback, implementing fixes, and rolling out significant improvements—most notably, a major update that enabled streaming videos from a user's local media server via DLNA/UPnP.
