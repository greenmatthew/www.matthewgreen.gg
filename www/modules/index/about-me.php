        Hello, I am Matthew Green, a 21-year-old recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Arlington from this past December. Now that I have received my degree I want to start a career in video game programming. Ever since I took a programming and game design course back in high school, it has been my ambition to develop video games as a career alongside accomplished peers. I have the correct skills and creativity to make a game become reality for the masses to enjoy. I also have found myself naturally taking a leadership role in the group projects I have taken part in, so I believe I could be a candidate for a managerial role in the future.

        After all the classes I have taken from high school to college and from my current job, I have nearly 5 years of programming experience in a range of languages and over a year of experience using Unity. I am incredibly comfortable programming in general and proficient with tools such as Unity and Git after all these years. I have been interested in learning Unreal Engine as well as Bevy, an open-source game engine, and the programming language used for it; Rust. While I enjoy all parts of programming a game what has been piquing my interest lately is graphics programming; more specifically procedural generation, shaders, and hardware acceleration using a graphics card. I have only just started learning about computer graphics and would like to learn about it further in detail. I did however take a computer graphics course, however, in my opinion it was quite a letdown on the amount of content it covered. It was unfortunate that my university did not have anything more on these topics because I would have loved to learn more about this fascinating subject in my studies.

        More about myself: I love everything entertainment, whether it be watching YouTube videos, playing video games with my friends, or collecting and watching movies. I also put a lot of time into self-hosting with my server computer, hosting many different services for my entertainment or utility, including this website.
