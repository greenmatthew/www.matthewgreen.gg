            <p>
                This is a sci-fi horror tactical FPS role playing game, made in Unity, where you take control of a
                bounty hunter who has crash landed on a mining colony planet, filled with horrific and violent alien
                creatures and people trying to kill you. Collect and craft items to help you survive and finish quests
                as you undercover the story of this planet and its humanoid inhabitants and their secret plans.
            </p>
            <p>
                Highly inspired by other games of the same genres, most notably the Dead Space franchise and others like
                it such as the Resident Evil franchise and The Callisto Protocol for the setting, horror atmosphere, and
                some parts of the gameplay. Then the gameplay being further enhanced with small parts borrowed from
                other games: Dark Souls franchise, Subnautica, Chernobylite, Escape From Tarkov, and SWAT4.

            <p>
                You take control of a bounty hunter who just got his biggest contract. Unfortunately, after a failed
                attempt to eliminate the target he crash landed on a prison mining colony. You need to gather the
                resources and items needed to repair his ship to finish his contract and get revenge for getting shot
                down.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mining colony is home to alien creatures, robots, and humanoid lowlifes, prisoners, and employees
                for the evil corporation in charge of the colony. As you explore more and finish more quests for people
                around the planet as well as missions for the corporation itself, you begin to learn more about the
                corporation's sinister plans for the mining on this planet. Will you try and stop them, or do you want
                to join them for your own selfish benefit?

                The planet's surface is mainly dirt and rock, but there are small amounts of resource rich flora across
                the surface. With many dangerous creatures and robots roaming the surface and caves also worth searching
                for resources. There are caves littered all around the surface, all plentifully filled with raw ores
                waiting to be mined; copper, titanium, iron, gold, silver, and more, however, the corporation does not
                seem to be mining these particularly common but useful ores right outside their compound.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a massive compound on the equator of the planet, owned by the corporation. Inside there is many
                different buildings and areas. Living quarters for prisoners, guards, engineers, and all sorts of other
                workers. Office spaces. Laboratories. Vehicle bays for spaceships and land vehicles. One gigantically
                tall building, where the top executives running the planet live and manage the planet. Then finally one
                massive quarry in the center of the compound, so far down you can't see anything at the bottom with
                large elevators that take people such as prisoners and guards down to the bottom to mine.
            </p>
            <p>
                The bounty hunter's spaceship crash lands on the outskirts of the compound. In a hot spot of caves and
                plenty and flora and fauna to fulfill upgrading your gear and start repairs on your ship, if you're
                willing to do a little exploring around.

                The Player Management Station (PMS) devices are a critical part of the gameplay loop and found all over
                the map. There are two different types of PMS: Alpha and Beta. They both have modules in them allowing
                the player to do certain things to help them survive. Beta PMS have less modules and reduced
                capabilities of said modules, whereas Alpha PMS have full the same exact modules with full capabilities
                and even more modules.
            </p>
            <h4 id="beta_pms">Beta PMS</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    All the same modules from the Beta PMS, but these modules can push and pull items into or from the
                    Stash Module.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stash Module - A place to store items for later use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Transportation Module - Can be used to transport to any other discovered Alpha PMS.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Market Module - Allows the selling of items for credits and the purchase of item recipes for credits
                    to unlock crafting recipes in the Crafting Module.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Memory Module - Allows the saving and loading of game states. As well as exiting the game
                    gracefully.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Upon using this type of PMS all the enemies will respawn on the map, however you will also heal, and
                    your shield will fully charge if you have one equipped.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These stations are inspired by the Dark Souls franchise bon fires and the Dead Space upgrade stations.
                They are basically a mix of the two, with the additional crafting module being directly inspired by
                Subnautica.

                The player's inventory contains multiple different slots for equipment.
            </p>
            <ul>
                Primary Weapon Slot - Can be used to equip long guns only.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Secondary Weapon Slot - Can be used to equip long guns or pistols.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Shield Slot - When equipped provides a pool of health that soaks all damage till the pool hits zero.
                Then all damage will be applied to the player's health instead.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Armor Slot - When equipped provides damage reduction from enemies' attacks.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Vest Slot - When equipped it has limited space with a restriction of only magazines, ammunition,
                grenades, and medical supplies items being allowed inside. There are different types of vests that can
                be equipped in this slot with pros and cons to each of them.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Backpack Slot - When equipped it has limited space but with no restrictions on what can be contained
                inside. There are different types of backpacks that can be equipped in this slot with pros and cons to
                each of them.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Credit Wallet - That displays how many credits you have.
            </ul>
            <p>
                Both the vests and backpacks have internal storage inside them, where you can move and rotate items to
                fit and organize items in the contents of these storage items. Which was inspired by Escape From
                Tarkov's inventory system and is a direct copy except for some removed and additional slots.
            </p>

                        Notice: All the slots are in the game, except for the vest and backpack slots, however,
                        there are no items other than a rifle and some example items and there is a fixed size storage
                        container just called backpack. So, the whole inventory system provides nothing to the final
                        build of the game. The only interaction with it is you immediately equip your rifle from an
                        Alpha PMS's stash module.

                There is a decent selection of different firearms that you can obtain or craft throughout the
                progression of the game. Some require ammunition cartridges and magazines. While others use energy and
                require batteries and capacitors. All these weapons have different fire modes or a mixture of fire
                modes, those being semi-automatic, fully-automatic, and three-round burst as well as some of the energy
                weapons shoot out a beam continuously for a short amount of time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Magazines must be loaded with cartridges, unlike most other games. You can do this by combining the
                magazine and the cartridges. It will automatically fill up the magazine to full capacity if you have
                enough cartridges or else it just fills the magazine as much as it can. You can also only reload the
                firearms using the magazines if you have a magazine in your vest. Same goes for throwing a grenade it
                must be in a vest to use. Both features are inspired from Escape From Tarkov.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are different types of AI used by the different enemies in the game with different levels of
                intellect and tactics. Animal creatures generally are not that smart and will attack head on and will
                fight to the death. While humanoids are usually smarter and will use cover, flee if they feel they are
                losing a fight, and if in a group will leverage that against you by working together.

                        Notice: In the final build there is only a single firearm, found in the stash with a magazine
                        item, but the magazine is nonfunctional, so the firearm just has infinite reloads for the
                        purposes of the demo. Also the AI is very basic and just goes directly towards a player and
                        attacks when in range. It has no sort of other logic now.

            <p>
                While Senior Design is two whole semesters, the first semester is nearly all documentation and planning,
                then the second is actually working on the project but also more documentation. While we understand the
                value of documentation we felt the planning and documentation was awkward and mostly a waste of time,
                because it had general engineering focus. The class did not feel suited for making a video game even
                though it was an allowed option. This cost us a lot of valuable development time.time.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also faced many other problems, such as scope creep, all but one team member had experience using
                Unity and C#, and underestimating our final semester's workloads and other responsibilities impact on
                how much we could get done. These aforementioned issues lead to the final build of the game being a
                shell of what it was supposed to be and short of a minimum viable product. It was missing many of the
                planned features and the that were implemented were only partially functional.
            </p>
            <p>
                We certainly learned the importance of keeping a project scope small and incrementally adding to the
                scope as features are finished, not before. As well as the importance of being truthful to ourselves on
                our skills and amount of work we can complete. In fact, this is the whole point of Senior Design; to
                learn about project pitfalls before enter industry.

                While that seems like a whole lot just to get to an MVP, we have most of the code already done for it
                and the code we don't have already should be easy to implement. The hardest issue would be optimization
                as we have never done it before.
